# Project Roadmap: DevOps & Cloud Engineer

This roadmap outlines beginner-friendly projects to help you build skills and showcase your progress in Python, AWS, GCP, Docker, CI/CD, and more.

## 1. Python Automation Scripts
- Write simple scripts to automate tasks (file management, data processing, etc.)
- Example: A script to back up files from one folder to another

## 2. Dockerize a Python App
- Create a basic Python web app (Flask or FastAPI)
- Write a Dockerfile to containerize it

## 3. Deploy to Railway (or Heroku)
- Deploy your Dockerized app to Railway
- Document the deployment process

## 4. AWS Basics
- Launch an EC2 instance and deploy your app
- Store/retrieve files from S3 using Python (boto3)
- Use IAM for secure access

## 5. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Basics
- Deploy a simple app to Google Compute Engine
- Store/retrieve files from Google Cloud Storage

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment of your app

## 7. Infrastructure as Code
- Use Terraform to provision cloud resources (EC2, S3, etc.)
- Document your IaC setup

## 8. Monitoring & Logging
- Set up basic monitoring (CloudWatch, Stackdriver, or open-source tools)
- Add logging to your Python app

> Add each project as a new folder in your portfolio, with a README describing what you learned and links to relevant code (if public).

# Cosmos Project

This project demonstrates my skills in DevOps and Cloud Engineering by deploying and managing a sample application called "Cosmos" using modern DevOps tools and cloud best practices.

## Project Overview
- Deploy a simple web application (Cosmos) using Docker.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable deployments.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
- Document the process and lessons learned.

## Technologies Used
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- (Optional: AWS, Azure, or GCP for cloud deployment)
- Terraform or Ansible (for IaC)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each subfolder (docker, ci-cd, infra, etc.).

## Folder Structure
- `/docker` – Dockerfiles and container setup
- `/ci-cd` – CI/CD pipeline configs
- `/infra` – Infrastructure as Code scripts
- `/docs` – Documentation and diagrams

## Status
Work in progress. More details and code coming soon!

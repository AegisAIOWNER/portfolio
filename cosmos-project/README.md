## 👤 ABOUT ME

I am a Business with Finance graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and technical product development.

Over the past year, I have been building a security scanning tool focused on automated vulnerability detection and scalable architecture.

My goal is to create reliable, production-ready tools that solve real security problems while maintaining ethical and legal compliance.

**I focus on:**
- Vulnerability detection automation
- Tool architecture design
- Product scalability
- Secure coding practices
- Performance optimisation

I am currently working on refining detection accuracy, scan stability, and horizontal scaling capabilities.

## 🛡️ CORE PROJECT — COSMOS Security Scanner

### Project Overview
COSMOS is a scalable vulnerability scanning tool designed to identify common web and infrastructure security issues across target systems. It supports domain and URL-based scanning and is built with extensibility in mind.

### Key Features
- Domain and port scanning capability
- Continuous discovery of endpoints
- Automated vulnerability detection engine
- Scalable architecture design
- Horizontal expansion capability
- Permission disclaimer enforcement before scanning
- Designed for heavy-load scanning environments

### Current Performance
- Detection accuracy: ~75%
- Stable under repeated scanning
- Handles multi-endpoint enumeration
- Designed for horizontal scaling (modular architecture approach)

### Technical Focus Areas
- False positive reduction
- Detection engine refinement
- Resource usage optimisation
- Error handling and recovery
- Secure scanning logic compliance
- Logging and audit trail tracking

### Future Roadmap
- Improve accuracy to 90%+
- AI-assisted vulnerability classification
- Smart prioritisation scoring
- User dashboard for vulnerability insights
- Rate limiting & safe scan mode
- Cloud-native deployment optimisation
- Compliance-ready logging system
